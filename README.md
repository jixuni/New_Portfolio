Responsive portfolio website


This is a responsive portfolio created using node-sass, wanted to experiement and learn it. It is a work in progress, will update/change things as I learn more tools. 


```
npm install node-sass

```


Sass has some very useful featuers like variables, function and conditional statement. Very useful script I found <strong>"sass": "node-sass -w scss/ -o dist/css/ --recursive" </strong> this will make it so it continously watch the scss file and compile with save, a .css file for it.
